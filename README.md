## I made this project SIMILAR looking, so it will not look exactly the same as Twitter

## Why React?

I did this project to start learning web development and to get an understand of JS/CSS/HTML as a whole. I decided to pick an opensourced JS library, and I was between Angular and React. I decided to choose React because I found it to be more intuitive, and I feel it could've been more applicable to my future jobs!

## Why Google Firebase?

I didn't know which cloud service I wanted to use for my back-end, but obviously I ended up choosing Google Firebase. I chose it because of its extreme simplicity, and easy to use/read syntax/documentation. Setting up the Firehouse database was so easy, and above it all I could host this website for FREE!

## What I learned

I feel like I learned a lot from this project, with it being my first time ever using React, as well as JS/HTML/CSS. Here is my list:
1. JavaScript fundamentals
2. Async functions in JS
3. How grueling CSS can be
4. React useEffect and useState
5. Google Firebase basics

## What would I do differently?

Above I talked about what I learned and I mentioned there are a lot of things I could've done differently, so heres my list:
1. Use Tailwind CSS
2. Use TypeScript rather than JS
3. Do a lot more with React's Router
