## Why React?

I did this project to start learning web development and to get an understand of JS/CSS/HTML as a whole. I decided to pick an opensourced JS library, and I was between Angular and React. I decided to choose React because I found it to be more intuitive, and I feel it could've been more applicable to my future jobs!

## Why Google Firebase?

I didn't know which cloud service I wanted to use for my back-end, but obviously I ended up choosing Google Firebase. I chose it because of its extreme simplicity, and easy to use/read syntax. Setting up the Firehouse database was so easy, and above it all I can host this website for FREE!
